# Play with Satan
My personal game project

This is a demo I did for learning, I will continue the project in a new version of Unity reusing all the desings of this project, I´m still planning the game mechanics.

I made all the sprites in aseprite and also the functionalitie of the game. I´m thinking on a better name for the game, maybe I will choose a friendlier one.
